## ✅ Running Tests

All solutions now have corresponding Go test files (*_test.go). You can run all tests from the root folder:

```go test -v ./...```


Or test a specific problem folder:

```go test -v ./easy/TwoSum```


This will automatically find all ```_test.go``` files and run the tests for all solutions.
